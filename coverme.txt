Hi,

I am a Machine Learning/NLP Researcher at BlackRock providing Deep Learning based solutions to various NLP problems. The inflection point in my career was a guest lecture by a Goldman Sachs professional, where he described how their algorithms are able to extract information from news articles. From that moment I commited myself deep into NLP research to improve upon the current approach towards text analytics. I did various in-house projects on twitter and news data analyis using regression and machine learning techniques. I gave up a few quant analyst intern opportunities to pursue NLP research under the guidance of global head of liquidity research at bloomberg. There I explored various machine learning based algorithms to solve NLP problems and achieved an accuracy ranging from 65% -70% in predicting the sentiment of the news headlines. Continuing my obejctive to research and develop state of the art NLP models, I explored Deep Learning techniques for news sentiment analysis tasks. I also took intiatives to automate the the weekly financial commentary practice using natural language generation employing artificial intelligence.
