3,K9M1OS0UQVIY,PLAIN,By Mark Bentley     Nov. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Turkish inflation probably slowed for athird consecutive month in October as a drop in oil costs andconsumer demand outweighed the impact of a decline in the lira.     The inflation rate fell to 11 percent from 11.1 percent inSeptember, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Istanbul,said in a telephone interview. ``Year-on-year, inflation will beslower.''     The decline in energy costs, combined with an economicslowdown in Turkey and the European Union, will help lower theinflation rate to between 6.1 percent and 9.1 percent next year,Central Bank Governor Durmus Yilmaz said on Oct. 31.     The central bank will publish its analysis of Octoberinflation data tomorrow.

4,K9M21Y0UQVJ5,PLAIN,By David Rosenberg     Nov. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., will post adjusted net income of$604 million, or 71 cents a share, up from $525 million, or 64cents, a year earlier, according to the median estimate of 12analysts polled by Bloomberg.     Revenue will climb about 24 percent to $2.93 billion from$2.37 billion in the same period in 2007, according to the survey.Teva is paying $7.5 billion for Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc. of theU.S. to expand in eastern Europe and gain contraceptives such asPlan B, the ``morning-after pill.'' Teva and Barr report resultson Nov. 6.     ``U.S. generic sales grew more slowly than in Europe and therest of the world, and there may even have been some erosion inolder generics,'' Noa Weisberg, an analyst at Israel Brokerage &Investments in Tel Aviv, said by phone. ``But new generics arethe name of the game, and Teva has most of the biggest sellingproducts. Together with Barr, its pipeline will be even bigger.''     Teva said Oct. 27 that it expects to complete takeover ofBarr, of Montvale, New Jersey, by the end of this year. The U.S.now accounts for about 57 percent of sales for Teva, which isbased in Petah Tikva, Israel.     Sales of Copaxone, the company's multiple sclerosistreatment, probably grew 28 percent in the U.S., said Weisberg,who rates the stock a ``buy'' and estimates its U.S.-tradedshares will reach $55 in the next 12 months.     Since it ended a joint marketing agreement with Sanofi-Aventis SA in the first quarter, Teva has been capturing 100percent of all profit on Copaxone sales instead of sharing itequally with the French company, she said.                         Markets Last Week     Last week in Israel, the benchmark 6.5 percent Shahar bonddue in January 2016 declined, with the yield rising 55 basispoints to 6.08 percent.

5,K9M26M0UQVI9,PLAIN,By Garth Theunissen     Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- South Africa's rand posted its biggestmonthly loss against the dollar in almost a quarter-century asinvestors sold emerging-market assets amid the world's worstfinancial crisis since the Great Depression.     The rand weakened the most last month since August 1985, headed for its biggest four-week loss inmore than 25 years.     ``The extreme sell-off we've seen in emerging markets isn'tsimply a case of irrational fear but a consequence of the re-pricing of credit and risk taking,'' said Shahin Vallee, anemerging-markets currency strategist in London at BNP Paribas SA,France's largest bank. ``The global credit crunch means there'sless money circulating in the world, which makes investors morediscriminating when it comes to where they put it.''     The rand fell almost 20 percent last month to 9.9200 perdollar by 6 p.m. in Johannesburg yesterday. It weakened versusall 16 major currencies monitored by Bloomberg, falling the mostin October versus the yen. The Australian and New Zealand dollarshad their steepest losses this month versus the U.S. currencysince the mid-1980s.     Emerging-market currencies including Hungary's forint andBrazil's real declined in October as investors cut holdings ofhigher-yielding assets in favor of safer holdings such as U.S.Treasuries. The rand was the second-weakest emerging-marketcurrency monitored by Bloomberg this month after Turkey's lira.                        `Striking Weakness'     ``The weakness in the rand isn't really surprising but theextent of the weakness against its emerging-market peers is quitestriking,'' said Vallee. ``It's come under a lot of sellingpressure.''     BNP Paribas is advising clients to keep ``buying dollars andselling rand,'' for at least the next week, Vallee said.     The currency of Africa's biggest economy slid versus thedollar and yen as interest-rate reductions in Asia, Europe andthe U.S. were unable to prevent a global equities sell-off thaterased more than $10 trillion of market value.     Stocks slipped around the world, with the MSCI World Index  posting its biggest monthly slump on record. South Africa'sFTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index fell for a fifth month, losing 12percent.                         Capital Outflows     Foreigners turned net sellers of almost 67 billion rand ofSouth African stocks and bonds this year, data from its exchangesshow. The nation relies on the inflows to finance its current-account deficit which is expected to reach 7.6 percent of grossdomestic product this year, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel saidOct. 21.     ``South Africa has a gaping current-account hole, which is asevere fundamental imbalance in the economy,'' said Bhanu Baweja,an emerging-markets currency strategist at UBS AG in London. ``Itneeds large flows of capital to finance its deficit and that'snot going to happen when the world wants to hold capital ratherthan invest it.''     UBS recommends clients continue ``hedging for downsiderisk'' in the rand against the dollar, euro and yen. ``I thinkthe rand will weaken further,'' said Baweja. The currency maytrade at 10.50 per dollar by year-end ``with the risk of furtherweakness,'' he added.     The rand also weakened this month as commodity prices fell,eroding prospects for earnings from exports. Commodities make upabout half of South Africa's income from abroad, data from theDepartment of Minerals and Energy show.     Gold slid more than 15 percent last month, its biggestplunge since February 1983. Platinum, which rivals gold as thecountry's biggest export, fell 20 percent, its fourth monthlyloss.     South Africa produces almost 80 percent of the world'splatinum and about 10 percent of its gold, typically causing therand to move in tandem with the metals' prices.                          `Panic Selling'     Government bonds fell in October, with the yield on thebenchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 adding 24basis points to 9.09 percent. Yields move inversely to bondprices.     The rand slumped more than 28 percent in August 1985 afterthe government declared a ``debt standstill,'' signaling itsinability to repay foreign lenders. ``Panic selling'' of the randforced the central bank to close its foreign-exchange market,according to the nation's treasury. It later re-negotiated theterms of its debt repayment.     ``It was an absolute disaster for the rand,'' according toIan Cruickshanks, head of research at Nedbank Treasury inJohannesburg. ``Those were really dark times.''For Related News:Top regional news TOP AFRICA <GO>South African Foreign Exchange TNI FX SAFRI <GO>Top currency stories TOP FX <GO>Top bond stories TOPH <GO>--Editors: Neil MacLucas, Ralph JohnstonTo contact the reporter on this story:Garth Theunissen in Johannesburg +27-11-286-1917 orgtheunissen@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story:Justin Carrigan at +44-20-7673-2502 orjcarrigan@bloomberg.net,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,K9M4370UQVIA,PLAIN,By John Fraher     Nov. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Jean-Claude Trichet is extending theEuropean Central Bank's powers just as it gears up for what maybe the fastest round of interest-rate cuts in its 10-yearhistory.     President Trichet has pushed the central bank's reach intothe euro region's neighboring economies as they struggle to copewith the financial crisis,'' said GuillaumeMenuet, a senior European economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. inLondon. ``Its mandate is being implicitly expanded.''     While Trichet's remit applies just to the 15-nation euroregion, the absence of an institution charged with financialstability across the 27-member European Union created a vacuumthe ECB is trying to fill. In the past three weeks alone, itgave a 5 billion-euro ($6.4 billion) loan to Hungary, set upcurrency swaps with Denmark and Switzerland and increased itslending to euro-region banks to more than $1 trillion.     Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany said on Oct. 28he's lobbying EU leaders to allow the ECB to provide liquidityoutside the euro area. ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo BiniSmaghi said on Oct. 31 the bank stands ready to help ``other''eastern European countries that are ``asking for our help.''     The Hungarian, Polish and Czech stock indexes all fell morethan 24 percent last month.                          `Major Danger'     Economists expect more rate cuts from the ECB as it triesto cushion an economy hurtling toward a recession.     The central bank will probably cut its key rate by a halfpoint this week, taking it to 3.25 percent, according to themedian of 50 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. It willdeliver another 75 basis points of easing in the following fivemonths.     Consumer and executive confidence in the euro region'seconomic outlook plunged by the most since at least 1985 inOctober, the European Commission said Oct. 30.     ``The ECB is only too well aware that extended, deeprecession is now the major danger facing the euro-zoneeconomies,'' said Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHSGlobal Insight in London.     The Bank of England will probably also cut its benchmark by50 basis points, taking it to 4 percent, according to a separatesurvey.                          Market Strains     Trichet and other policy makers are still trying to easestrains in financial markets that are crippling the globaleconomy. Europe's corporate debt markets endured their worstmonth on record in October and the gap between the yields on 10-year German and Italian government bonds widened to 1.27 percenton Oct. 31, the most since 1997.     The ECB has responded by ramping up lending to cash-strapped banks, offering unlimited funds. The central bank saidon Oct. 21 that lending to financial institutions jumped to arecord, surging 68 percent from the first week of September.     That may create problems for the ECB as the risk ofpossible collateral losses grows, says Natacha Valla, a formerECB economist and now at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in Paris.     ``They have challenges for the future in having a balancesheet of unprecedented size,'' said Valla. ``The have to knowhow to deal with such a balance sheet, how much capital theyhave to hold, what it means for risk management. There is awhole set of questions that now have to be answered.''                             Not Alone     The ECB isn't the only European institution trying toguarantee financial stability. The EU said on Oct. 29 it's readyto contribute 6.5 billion euros to an International MonetaryFund-led rescue package for Hungary, and European governmentscoordinated efforts last month to shore up the region's bankingsystem.     Still, some economists and politicians say the ECB'spivotal position at the heart of the financial system should bemore formally recognized.     Hungary's Gyurcsany said on Oct. 28 he wants EU leaders toallow the ECB to accept local government bonds as collateral forforeign-currency swaps, saying ``it is extremely important fromPoland to Hungary to have these repo facilities in place.''     ``My dream is that the ECB gets a financial stabilitymandate, which is not the case so far,'' said Valla. ``The ECBreally has demonstrated it can fulfill such a mandate.''For Related News:Stories on the ECB: NI ECB <GO>On money markets: NI MMK BN <GO>On the credit crunch: NI CRUNCH BN <GO>Search for central bank stories: NSE MONETARY POLICY <GO>Stories on ECB interest rates: STNI ECBACTION <GO>--Editors: Matthew Brockett, Andrew AtkinsonTo contact the reporter on this story:John Fraher in London at +44-20-7673-2058 orjfraher@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story:Riad Hamade at +49-69-9204-1214 or rhamade@bloomberg.net.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,K9M4V60D9L35,PLAIN,By Kim-Mai Cutler and Agnes Lovasz     Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- European two-year government notesposted the biggest monthly advance since September 1992 amidspeculation the region's central bank will lower interest ratesnext week to head off a recession in the 15-nation economy.     The gains sent the difference in yield between two- and 10-year bonds to the most in almost four years as shorter-datednotes,'' said Nick Stamenkovic, a fixed-income strategist inEdinburgh at RIA Capital Markets. ``The market has significantlyshifted its views on the ECB. The rapidly deteriorating economicoutlook points to significant rate cuts and the continued weakperformance of risky assets is giving support to bunds.''     The yield on the two-year German note fell 11 basis pointsthis past week to 2.55 percent by late yesterday in London. Theyield slid 92 basis points since Sept. 30, for its fourthmonthly loss. The 4 percent bond due September 2010 rose 0.16,or 1.6 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,276) face amount this week, to102.57.     The yield on the 10-year bund climbed 14 basis points to3.89 percent, paring its decline since Sept. 30 to 12 basispoints. Yields move inversely to bond prices.                        Demand for Safety     The two-year note, which hasn't risen for four consecutivemonths since March 2004, surged as concern the credit-marketmeltdown will push the global economy into a recession sappeddemand for higher-yielding assets. Equities around the worldslumped, pushing the MSCI World Index of stocks to its worstfour-week loss on record.     The spread between two- and 10-year yields widened to 134basis points, near the most since December 2004, steepening theso-called yield curve, a chart of bonds of different maturities.     Ten-year German bunds yielded less than comparable U.S.Treasuries for the first time this week since November 2007.Ten-year U.S. Treasury notes yielded 5 basis points more thanbunds.     The yield spread between bunds and other debt of the samematurity in the region is the widest since 1997 as investorssought the most liquid of government bond markets. The gapbetween bunds and their Italian counterparts widened to 127basis points yesterday. The difference with Spanish 10-year debtwas 69 basis points as the country's economy contracted in thethird quarter for the first time since 1993.                      'Punishing Countries'     ``The market seems to be punishing those countries thathave adopted large-scale rescues for the banking sector,''Stamenkovic said. ``Italy always seems to be on the firing lineas well because of its poor historical record and fiscaldeficits.''     Gains for bonds may be limited because European governmentdebt sales may reach 750 billion euros ($955 billion) next yearas larger budget deficits and the cost of bank recapitalizationplans boost issuance, according to analysts at UBS AG in London.     ``We expect most of the issuance to occur'' with shorter-dated notes, Meyrick Chapman, a fixed-income strategist inLondon at UBS AG, wrote in a client note. ``However the weightof issuance, combined with a lack of buying interest for longer-dated maturities will result in considerably higher realyields'' for longer-dated notes.     Bonds also gained after a government report showedconsumer-price growth in the region slowed this month. Theinflation rate fell to 3.2 percent, from 3.6 percent inSeptember, the European Union's statistics office in Luxembourgsaid yesterday. That matched the median estimate of 27economists surveyed by Bloomberg.                           Retail Sales     Retail sales in Germany, Europe's largest economy, fellmore than economists expected in September. Sales slipped 2.3percent from August, the Federal Statistics Office saidyesterday. Economists forecast a drop of 1 percent, the medianof 15 estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed.     Inflation in the euro area was last below 3 percent a yearago and has been above the ECB's 2 percent ceiling in everymonth since September 2007.     The ECB participated in a coordinated interest-ratereduction by global central banks on Oct. 8 to prevent thecollapse of the global financial system, reducing its benchmarkrate by half a point to 3.75 percent. The Bank of Japanyesterday lowered its main rate to 0.3 percent to spur growth.     Policy makers meet Nov. 6, when they will probably cut theregion's main refinancing rate a half point to 3.25 percent,according to a Bloomberg survey of 26 economists.     The implied yield on the three-month Euribor futurescontract due in January fell 20 basis points this past week to3.42 percent, suggesting traders are increasing bets borrowingcosts have further to fall.     European bonds outperformed Treasuries this month, handinginvestors a 2 percent return, compared with 0.1 percent fortheir U.S. counterparts, according to Merrill Lynch & Co.'s EMUDirect and Treasury Master indexes.For Related News:Stories on bonds: NI BON <GO>Stories on European government debt: TNI EUROPE GBN <GO>--Editors: Neil MacLucas, Ralph JohnstonTo contact the reporter on this story:Agnes Lovasz in London at +44-20-7330-7614 oralovasz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story:Justin Carrigan at +44-20-7673-2502 or jcarrigan@bloomberg.net,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,K9M94Y07SXKY,PLAIN,Review by John Mariani     Nov. 3 (Bloomberg) -- On first sniff I thought the wine wasa little corked. Yet after a few swirls,the problem revealed itself in an explosion of high-alcohol,grapey, oaky flavors that seemed to epitomize all that is wrongwith what has been called the globalization of wine.     Here was a wine that was technically unflawed -- clean,smooth and bright. The bottle lingo, by winemaker Silvio Alberto,reads, ``Full bodied and complex, it exhibits aromas of ripe redfruits and spices with flavors of red fruit, spice, and anise andnotes of vanilla and chocolate that complement the roundedtannins.''     The repetition of the words ``red fruit'' and ``spice'' inone sentence should tell you something: This is winespeak,hitting all the Pavlovian notes used to describe thousands ofmodern red wines around the world, from Argentina to Croatia,seeking to cash in on the global taste for big, alcoholic reds.     Andeluna was founded in 2003 by Dallas investor H. Ward Lay,of Lay Capital Group (his father, Herman W. Lay, founded Frito-Lay). The younger Lay lives much of the year on his 200,000-acrecattle ranch in Patagonia.     The Andeluna Pasionado bottle, which sports a sticker fromDecanter magazine awarding a gold medal to the wine, also extolsthe consultant Michel Rolland, a controversial figure in the wineworld who often has advocated pumping up red wines by delayingpicking the grapes until extremely ripe. He also sometimesrecommends using a process called micro-oxygenation, by whichsmall bubbles of oxygen are added to wines to make them rounder,allowing them to age faster in stainless-steel tanks to achievethe slower, natural oxidation that oak barrels provide.     Andeluna's importer, San Francisco Wine Exchange, saysmicro-oxygenation is not used for the wine.                            Mature at 5     But the way Andeluna is made is telling: For a five-year-oldwine blended from 35 percent cabernet sauvignon, 35 percentmerlot, 20 percent malbec and 10 percent cabernet franc, it isvery mature, the tannins very soft. The real problem is that ittastes like a hundred other wines of its kind -- the global tasteyou find when a very new, very well endowed winery lacks thetradition to know just what their vineyards may be capable ofexpressing.     Had I tasted Andeluna Pasionado blind, I would no more guessthat it was from Mendoza than I might think it came fromMendocino County, California, or Valencia, Spain, or Ragusa,Sicily.                        Designed for Awards     This is a wine designed to win awards, the kind of cabernetthat California cult wine faddists say will ``blow your doorsoff.'' It tastes more of the lab than of the individual vineyard,like prune juice more than good wine, so cloying in its fruit, solacking in a fine edge of acid, that my wife and I left half thebottle undrunk while having a simple dinner of grilled pork chopsand white beans.     The fact that the label noted a minimum alcohol volume of14.7 percent also made this something of an ordeal to finish.This is not outrageously high for a cabernet blend, though it issymptomatic of the levels achieved where the wine tastes ``hot''and the nose is full of alcohol.     Andeluna Pasionado is not a poorly made wine -- in fact,it's a very carefully made wine -- but it is not the kind of winethat expresses the best coming out of Argentina's Mendoza Valley,where malbec has shown the most distinction as a varietal. It istoo big, too rich and too alcoholic. It lacks both dimension andthe character of terroir.     There is a lot wrong with a world of wine where attempts aremade to have every varietal taste more or less the same and wherehugeness and over-ripeness are seen as a virtue as much as theyare a marketing strategy.     (John Mariani writes on wine for Bloomberg News.

10,K9MERU1A1I4H,PLAIN,By Carlos Torres     Nov. 3 (Bloomberg) -- More companies in the U.S. will cutjobs and spending after the credit crisis intensified and salesslumped, when the economywas emerging from the last official recession.     Almost half the respondents said the credit crunch haddirectly hurt business, and nearly three-quarters said it harmedtheir customers, leading to the biggest deterioration in sales inthe survey's history. The report reinforces concern the economyis heading for the worst contraction in decades.     ``The ongoing financial crisis is pulling down the overalleconomy,'' NABE board member Ken Simonson, chief economist forthe Associated General Contractors of America in Alexandria,Virginia, said in a statement.     The U.S. lost 760,000 jobs in the first nine months of thisyear and the unemployment rate was at a five-year high of 6.1percent in September, according to figures from the LaborDepartment. The October jobs report is due in four days.     For the first time since the last recession in 2001, morecompanies said sales dropped last quarter than said demandimproved, the survey showed.                         Recession Signal     ``Every time since 1982 that this indicator has turnednegative, the economy has later proved to be in a recession,''Simonson said. The quarterly survey was first taken 26 years ago.     Consumer spending shrank at a 3.1 percent annual pace fromJuly through September, the first decline since 1991 and thebiggest since 1980, the Commerce Department reported last week.The slump in purchases caused the economy to contract at a 0.3percent pace.     As sales drop, companies are also cutting back on expenses,the NABE survey showed. A net two percent of the firms said theywould increase spending on new buildings and equipment over thenext 12 months, compared with 27 percent surveyed in the secondquarter. At the end of 2007, that reading was 40 percent.     Slumping sales and increases in commodity costs hurtearnings, the survey showed. The number of respondents sayingprofit margins declined last quarter exceeded those registeringgains by 29 percent, the biggest differential since 1982.     The report contained some good news on the inflation frontas fewer companies believed they could increase prices. For thefirst time in more than a year, more respondents forecast priceswill decline over the next three months than rise.                           Fewer Raises     The weakening job market also caused wages to soften. Only12 percent of respondents said they boosted employee pay lastquarter, a five-year low, the survey said.     Nine of 10 respondents said they were more pessimistic aboutthe outlook for economic growth than they were during the lastsurvey issued in July. Forty-one percent projected the economywould grow between zero and 1 percent in 2009, and 38 percentpredicted it would shrink. Just 2 percent forecast it wouldexpand 2 percent or more.     The U.S. economy, the world's largest, grew 2.9 percent ayear on average over the last decade.     The poll was taken between Oct. 10 and Oct. 23, and includedresponses from 102 members of the business economists group.For Related News:For stories on the U.S. economy: TNI USECO ECO BN <GO>.Stories on inflation: TNI US INF <GO>.--Editors: Brendan Murray, Mark RohnerTo contact the report on this story:Carlos Torres in Washington at +1-202-624-1818 orCtorres2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story:Chris Anstey at +1-202-624-1972 or canstey@bloomberg.net,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,K9MFY60YHQ0X,PLAIN,By Bob Willis     Nov. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Manufacturing in the U.S. probablycontracted in October at the fastest pace since the 2001recession as the credit crisis deepened and companies slashedorders,'' MichaelGregory, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto,said before the report. ``It's the stuff recessions are made of.The longer we go without credit, the greater is the risk therecession will be more severe.''     The Tempe, Arizona-based ISM's factory report is due at 10a.m. New York time. Forecasts from the 63 economists surveyedrange from 38 to 48.5.     A report from the Commerce Department at the same time mayshow spending on construction projects fell 0.8 percent inSeptember, according to economists surveyed. Commercial building,after holding its own as housing collapsed, has begun weakeningand will contribute to the drop, economists said.                      Economy, Election     As financial markets imploded in the last two months and theBush administration led a massive bid to rescue banks, Democraticcandidate Barack Obama took the lead in polls over Republicanrival John McCain as voters perceived the Illinois senator wouldbe better able to address economic concerns.     The seizing up of credit markets since mid-September hasworsened the outlook. Companies are cutting back on investmentsand hiring as consumer spending in the third quarter plunged by3.1 percent, the biggest decline in 28 years.     GMAC LLC, the lender partly owned by General Motors Corp.,is telling some GM dealers it will no longer provide financing tobuy vehicles because of its own reduced funding, according toletters sent to the retailers.     ``Turbulence in the markets reduced our access to funds andincreased the cost of funds where available,'' GMAC ChiefExecutive Officer Alvaro de Molina said in a letter sent Oct. 21to the California New Car Dealers Association. ``In response, weadjusted our credit policy to reflect the reduced level offunding availability.''                      Economy Contracts     The economy shrank at a 0.3 percent pace in the thirdquarter, with spending on equipment and software declining at a5.5 percent rate, the biggest drop since the first quarter of2002. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the economy willshrink at a 0.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter.     In a bid to keep the downturn from becoming the worstrecession in the postwar era, the Federal Reserve last week cutits key rate a half point to 1 percent, matching a 50-year low.     ``Business equipment spending and industrial production haveweakened in recent months, and slowing economic activity in manyforeign economies is damping the prospects for U.S. exports,''the Fed said. ``Downside risks to growth remain.''For Related News:For U.S. economy stories: TNI US ECO <GO> OR NI USECO <GO>For U.S. manufacturing stories: TNI US MAC <GO>For stories on manufacturing and trade: TNI TRD MAC <GO>*T                          Bloomberg News================================================================                               ISM      ISM Construct                              Manu   Prices Spending                             Index    Index     MOM%================================================================Date of Release              11/03    11/03    11/03Observation Period            Oct.

13,K9MIHN0YHQ0X,PLAIN,By Tiffany Kary and Christopher Scinta     Nov. 3 (Bloomberg) -- In the last quarter century, using holiday salescash to jump-start reorganizations or finance liquidations.     This bankruptcy season is different. Retailers with reducedrevenue or bloated debt are closing down early because of aconsumer spending slump linked to the credit crunch, dwindlinginventory values and restrictive changes in the bankruptcy law,said Jonathan Henes, a lawyer at Chicago-based Kirkland & Ellis.More liquidations are coming, he said.     ``There's going to be tension between allowing retailers toget through the holiday season versus liquidating in Decemberwhere a lender may have the best chances of getting repaid,''said Henes, who specializes in bankruptcy law.     Already Value City Department Stores LLC, an operator of 66discount stores, jumped the January gun and filed for bankruptcyOct. 27, saying it would conduct close-out sales. Three companiesalready in bankruptcy -- Linens 'n Things Inc., the housewaresretailer, Shoe Pavilion Inc., and Mervyns LLC, a department storechain, announced this month they'd liquidate, not reorganize.     The wait-till-January tactic, employed by Kmart Corp. andjewelry retailer Zale Corp. in years past, was designed to buildup a war chest to attract investors as part of a reorganizationor to pay off lenders that might then provide bankruptcyfinancing, lawyers said. Holiday sales sometimes helped avoidbankruptcy if companies got lucky with a buying spike.     Tight credit markets have dried up bankruptcy financing --so-called debtor-in-possession or DIP loans, Henes said. WithoutDIP loans to finance a reorganization, companies will be forcedto go out of business. The incentive to soften up lenders withpayoffs aimed at getting DIP loans doesn't apply now, said MartinZohn, a bankruptcy lawyer at New York-based Proskauer Rose.                        Retail Bankruptcies     Among distressed companies, electronics retailer CircuitCity Stores Inc. has hired a turnaround firm, FTI Consulting Inc.to try and reverse six straight quarters of declining sales.Department store Boscov's Inc., already in bankruptcy, is hopingto find a buyer to avoid liquidation. Borders Group Inc.,searching for a buyer to rescue it from $11 million in second-quarter losses, a lack of financing and tough competition, hasfailed so far to find one.     Retailers with distressed bonds tracked by Bloomberg includeFinlay Fine Jewelry Corp., Rafaella Apparel Group., Lazydays RVCenter Inc., True Temper Sports Inc., Claire's Stores Inc.,Dillards Inc., Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corp., MichaelsStores Inc., and Rite Aid Corp.                      The January Phenomenon     From 1980 to 2008, of the 105 large public retailers thatfiled for bankruptcy with assets of more then $100 million, onlyseven did so in December, giving up the full benefit a holidaycash infusion, according to statistics compiled by Lynn LoPucki,a law professor who teaches at Harvard University and theUniversity of California.     That was less than half the 18 that did so in January -- themost popular filing month for large retailers -- and slightlyless than the 10 that filed in February after January clearancesales, he said.     ``Seventy to 80 percent of bankruptcy filings in the retailsector traditionally take place at the end of high sellingseasons,'' said Albert Nassi, a managing member at Tiger CapitalGroup LLC, a retail liquidation contractor since 1972.     No longer, he said.     ``Things have changed,'' he said. ``Credit has tightenedsubstantially, and the companies along with the creditors arefinding that if they wait, the value of the inventory is going tobe substantially lower.''                        Inventory Pressure     Companies specializing in electronics, jewelry, clothing,and other popular gift items would benefit more from a pre-Christmas liquidation, while inventory values for items likefurniture and other holiday items are actually higher in January,he said.     Tiger Capital, which has helped Linens `n Things and ValueCity liquidate, estimates that companies that liquidate inNovember or December may get 10 percent to 20 percent more thanif they wait until January when consumers' gift-giving impulsesare over.     ``Confidence has deteriorated so badly that merchants andbankers don't even believe in Santa Claus any more,'' Zohn said.     J. Scott Victor, senior managing director at National CityCapital Markets, said that if a retailer is severely distressedwith debt payments, a cash shortage or sagging sales, liquidatingbefore Christmas is ``a better alternative'' than waiting.     Gordon Brothers Group, a financial and liquidation adviser,is ``actively talking to potential clients who are looking atliquidations now,'' said Chief Investment Officer WilliamWeinstein. He predicts that companies that had limited purchasingpower last spring -- when most retailers stock up for holidaysales -- will go into early liquidation. For retailers that werehealthy then, most will see out the Christmas season, he said.                            Value City     Value City, for example, said in its bankruptcy filing thatwithout enough money to keep its shelves well-stocked with enoughinventory, it couldn't keep operations at a profitable level orkeep borrowing money under its credit agreement with lenders.     Kirkland's Henes said changes to the U.S. bankruptcy law in2005 are also encouraging retailers to liquidate rather thanreorganize. One amendment gives trade creditors that suppliedgoods to a company within 20 days prior to its bankruptcy a so-called administrative claim. Such claims need to be repaid beforemost others, so lenders thinking about DIP financing need tofactor in such payments now.    Another amendment requires companies to assume or rejectleases within 270 days of their bankruptcy filing. That's shorterthan previously, when judges granted routine extensions of lease-rejection deadlines.

14,K9MK2R1A1I4H,PLAIN,By Elizabeth Amon     Nov. 3 (Bloomberg) -- A New York judge rejected HexionSpecialty Chemicals Inc.'s request to force two banks to extendtheir financing commitment for its $6.5 billion takeover ofHuntsman Corp.     State Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten in Manhattandisagreed with Hexion's claim that it would suffer ``irreparableharm'' if Credit Suisse Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG didn'tleave the funding agreement in place beyond the Nov. 1 deadline.     Hexion, has led the group to considera new transaction at a price less than the original $28 a share.     Hexion believes it may be able to force the banks to fundthe Huntsman deal even after the expiration date, Bransten said,citing Marc Kasowitz, a Hexion lawyer. Hexion sued the CreditSuisse and Deutsche Bank units on Oct. 29, asking a judge toorder them to ``fulfill their obligations to finance themerger.''     Hexion agreed last year to buy The Woodlands, Texas-basedHuntsman, the world's biggest maker of epoxy adhesives. Thetransaction was delayed by legal disputes over financing and wasscheduled to be completed Oct. 28.     ``All of the time Hexion could have moved, could have donethings well in advance of the Nov. 1,2008, deadline,'' Branstensaid Oct. 31 following a hearing. ``If Hexion had done so, itwould have eliminated the urgency to do something today.''     The banks notified Hexion of their decision on Oct. 27, theColumbus, Ohio-based company said in a statement. Credit Suisse,based in Zurich, and Deutsche Bank of Frankfurt rejected asolvency opinion by American Appraisal Associates Inc. and acertificate signed by Huntsman's chief financial officer.     Apollo, the New York-based private-equity firm run by LeonBlack and Joshua Harris, initially made a similar argument aboutthe combined company's finances. Huntsman sued Hexion in June inDelaware Chancery Court to meet the terms of their takeoveragreement.     Chancery Judge Stephen Lamb on Sept. 29 sided with Huntsman,ruling that a slump in the chemical markets didn't give Hexiongrounds to terminate the purchase and ordered the company tohonor the agreement.     On Oct. 21, Hexion lost a bid to extend the period duringwhich the buyout must take place. Hexion on Oct. 27 filed anappeal of Lamb's September ruling in Delaware Supreme Court.     ``We will continue to pursue our claims for damages in bothDelaware and Texas,'' said Russ Stolle, a Huntsman spokesman.``Whatever the status of Hexion's arguments versus the banks, webelieve Huntsman has been harmed by both Hexion's and the banks'actions.''    Kasowitz said Hexion won't seek an appeal of the decision andwill return to court today to ask Bransten to order the banks tofund the merger. Kasowitz argued that Hexion believes the banksare obligated to provide the financing even after the commitmentletter expires.     Richard Clary, a lawyer for the banks, told Bransten thatthe banks don't accept that argument.     The case is Hexion Specialty Chemicals Inc. v. CreditSuisse, 114552/2008, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).Kerviel's SocGen Bosses Told Him to Hide Bets, Mediapart Says     Jerome Kerviel said his three immediate superiors at SocieteGenerale SA knew about his bets before the bank claimed itdiscovered the positions that led to its record trading loss,Mediapart reported, citing a transcript of a meeting between theauditors, bank, defense and judges.     The three were complicit in his actions because ``they letme act while they were perfectly aware of the positions beingtaken,'' Kerviel said to judges investigating the 4.9-billion-euro ($6.2 billion) loss, according to the transcript publishedby the on-line news service.     ``There were instructions to disguise the surplus end-of-year results,'' Kerviel said, when asked why he covered up a1.4 billion-euro profit at the end of 2007, according toMediapart.     Kerviel said he didn't tell the bank his bosses knew whathe'd been doing when first asked to explain the unauthorizedtrades in mid-January because he was ``stressed,'' the onlinenews service said, citing the transcript.     Lawyers for the bank and Kerviel declined to comment on thereport when contacted by Bloomberg News.For more lawsuits news from last week, click here.

Poulsen,65,cheated investors who bought National Century bonds to back thepurchase of unpaid insurance bills from medical providers thatneeded cash, prosecutors said. The company advanced $2.2 billionto six companies in which Poulsen owned a stake, they said.     ``This is one of the largest frauds the FBI has everinvestigated,'' Justice Department trial attorney Leo Wise toldjurors during the trial. ``Investors were told their money wouldbe used to buy accounts receivable. They got a worthless IOU inmany cases from a health-care provider teetering on the edge ofbankruptcy.''     Poulsen, who founded the Dublin, Ohio-based company, facesfrom 30 years to life in prison. He already is serving 10 yearsafter his conviction in March for trying to bribe the mainwitness against him.     The case is U.S. v. Poulsen, 06-129, U.S. District Court,Southern District of Ohio (Columbus).ICO Wins $236 Million Punitive Damages Verdict Against Boeing     ICO Global Communications Holdings Ltd. won $236 million inpunitive damages against Boeing Co. and one of its units over afailed agreement to build a satellite telecommunications network.     Jurors in Los Angeles Superior Court awarded ICO $59 millionagainst Boeing Satellite Systems and $177 million against theparent company on Oct. 31. The punitive damages come on top of$370.6 million in compensatory damages the jury awarded Reston,Virginia-based ICO on Oct. 21.     The jurors last week agreed with ICO's arguments that Boeingunfairly demanded additional money to finish and launch thesatellites, which ICO ordered to create mobile-phone connectionsto remote locations worldwide. Boeing said it would appeal theverdict, which was the fourth-largest in the U.S. this year,according to Bloomberg data.     The case is Boeing Satellite Systems International Inc. v.ICO Global Communications (Operations) Ltd., BC320115, LosAngeles County Superior Court.Schering to Pay $31 Million to Resolve Missouri Medicaid Claims     Schering-Plough Corp. agreed to pay $31 million to the stateof Missouri to resolve claims it overcharged the state's Medicaidprogram for some medicines.     The settlement resolves allegations that Schering's Warrickunit inflated prices for medicines in a way that way that costMissouri taxpayers millions of dollars, Scott Holste, a spokesmanfor State Attorney General Jay Nixon, said in an e-mailedstatement.     On Oct. 30, a jury in St. Louis ruled that Kenilworth, NewJersey-based Schering must pay $7.3 million in compensatorydamages for the overcharging. The panel was to meet Oct. 31 todetermine whether to award punitive damages.     Schering spokesman Lee Davies did not return a telephonecall seeking comment.DuPont, Rhodia Win Dismissal of Invista Trade Lawsuit     DuPont Co. and Rhodia SA won dismissal of a lawsuit by KochIndustries Inc.'s Invista unit, the world's biggest nylon maker,accusing the chemical companies of conspiring to steal a tradesecret.     DuPont sold Invista to Wichita, Kansas-based Koch in 2004for $4.2 billion. The transaction included the sale of so-calledGen 1 technology to produce adiponitrile, or ADN, a chemical usedto make some types of nylon, according to a complaint filed byInvista in August in federal court in Manhattan.     ``The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and dismissesInvista's complaint,'' U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones wrote ina 12-page opinion Oct. 31. Jones said in her opinion thatInvista's claims were made under state law and gave Invistaapproval to refile those claims.     Invista claimed DuPont, the third-largest U.S. chemicalmaker, agreed to operate an ADN manufacturing plant in Asia forRhodia that would use Gen 1 technology. Rhodia, based in Paris,had learned about the ADN process through a confidential jointventure with Invista in France, Invista claimed. Rhodia joinedforces with DuPont to build an ADN plant in Asia and ``to competeunfairly,'' according to the complaint.     Daniel Turner, a spokesman for Wilmington, Delaware-basedDuPont, didn't have an immediate comment. An Invistarepresentative didn't return a call seeking comment.     Invista said the Gen 1 process, which was developed byDuPont, produces high-quality ADN and leads to hundreds ofmillions of dollars in annual revenue. In its French jointventure with Rhodia, Invista said it insisted that itsproprietary technology remain protected.     Rhodia has been teaming up with DuPont to use Gen 1technology to manufacture ADN in Asia, where demand is expectedto ``dramatically increase in the next decade,'' Invista said inits lawsuit, alleging that their ``conspiracy'' is a theft of acritical trade secret.     The case is Invista v. DuPont, 08-cv-7270, U.S. DistrictCourt, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).Sidel Investors Should Be Awarded Higher Damages, Court Says     Investors in Sidel SA, whose machines once made more thanhalf of the world's plastic drink bottles, won a court bid toincrease an earlier verdict awarding them 10 euros ($13) a sharein connection with the sale of the company.     The Paris Court of Appeals said at a hearing Oct. 31 that itwould add extra damages to the initial 10 euro per share award.The amount of extra damages may be determined later at thehearing.     About 700 shareholders appealed the 2006 ruling validating a2 million-euro settlement that Sidel paid four years earlier toDeminor International SCRL, a consultant to holders of minoritystakes, to resolve the claims of about 1,000 investors.     The investors told the appeals court that they only acceptedthe offer because they'd been kept in the dark about thecompany's financial status. A report by the French marketregulator found that the company and former directors publishedfalse or misleading information and overstated profits from 1998through 2000.     The investors said they would never have bought shares hadthey known the truth of Sidel's financial situation. Nor wouldthey have accepted, as management recommended they do, a 50-europer share buyout offer by Switzerland's Tetra Laval InternationalSA in 2001. The European Commission vetoed the deal asanticompetitive. That decision was overturned on appeal and thesale was completed in January 2003.For more verdict and settlement news from last week, click here.For more trial and appeals news from last week, click here.                      Litigation DepartmentsFred Baron, Edwards Campaign Finance Chairman, Dies of Cancer     Fred Baron, the lawyer who won billions of dollars forclients in asbestos cases and served as finance chairman of JohnEdwards's presidential campaign, died of blood cancer Oct. 30 athis home in Dallas. He was 61.     Baron, a founder of the Baron & Budd law firm, said he hadworked as a youth sweeping mounds of asbestos from a factoryfloor. He later built his legal career by suing makers and usersof the material, including W.R. Grace & Co. and Halliburton Co.,over claims that exposure caused lung disease and mesothelioma, afatal cancer. Baron & Budd also represented clients claiminginjuries from drugs and toxic chemicals.     ``Fred Baron left his fingerprint on the law, the victimsand the profession,'' Mark Lanier, the Houston lawyer whorepresents Baron's family and worked with him on a $4.5 billionasbestos settlement, said Oct. 31 in a telephone interview.``This world is a better place because of Fred Baron.''     Baron received a Biogen Idec Inc. drug to treat his cancerearlier in the month after pleas by former President BillClinton, cycling champion Lance Armstrong and Baron's wife, LisaBlue, who also is an attorney at Dallas-based Baron & Budd. Baronwas days from death, his son, Andrew, wrote in a letter to thecompany sent Oct. 15.     The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized anoncologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, to giveBaron the drug, Tysabri, under a rule for compassionate use. Thedrug is approved to treat multiple sclerosis and Crohn's diseaseand is in the early stages of testing for multiple myeloma, theblood disease that killed Baron.Broadcom Appoints Technology Lawyer Chong as General Counsel     Broadcom Corp., the chipmaker that has fought rival QualcommInc. in courts since 2005, named technology and insurance lawyerArthur Chong general counsel.     Chong,55, spent more than 20 years at McKesson Corp., a SanFrancisco-based information-technology and health-care servicescompany, before joining Seattle-based insurance company SafecoCorp. as chief legal officer in 2005. He will start immediately,Broadcom said Oct. 31 in a statement.     Broadcom, which makes chips for flat-panel televisions andApple Inc.'s iPhone, is entangled in royalty and patent suitsover its technology. Those include multiple disputes withQualcomm that followed Broadcom's expansion into the mobile-phonesemiconductor market four years ago.     Chong replaces Alvin Segel, a California lawyer who wasnamed acting general counsel in May after his predecessor DavidDull was sued by regulators over the dating of stock optionsalong with co-founder Henry Samueli.For more litigation department news from last week, click here.                          On the DocketNigeria Adjourns $44 Billion Tobacco Suit to January, AFP Says     A Nigerian court adjourned a $44 billion lawsuit againstBritish American Tobacco Plc and other cigarette makers untilJan. 19, Agence France-Presse reported Oct. 29, citing legaldocuments.     Judge Adamu Bello gave the government permission to servePhilip Morris International Inc. with a summons via diplomaticchannels after four failed attempts to notify the company, thenews service said.

15,K9MMZT1A74E9,PLAIN,By Susanna Ray     Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. machinists will castballots today on whether to end the third-longest walkout in theplanemaker's history as they pick up their $150 weekly unionstrike stipends in Washington,which union leaders unanimously endorsed this week.     The 57-day strike has idled Boeing's Seattle-areamanufacturing hub, cutting profit by $10.3 million and revenue by$100 million each day and further delaying the new 787Dreamliner. Even if employees accept the new contract and startgoing back to work tomorrow night as planned, the company mayneed until December to get assembly lines back up to speed, saidJoseph Campbell, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York.     ``Boeing doesn't want to budge in anything that would affectits competitive position in a downturn, so this is probably thebest deal the machinists are going to get given the economy andthe way the market is headed,'' said Richard Aboulafia, ananalyst with aviation consulting firm Teal Group in Fairfax,Virginia, who has been a Boeing watcher for more than 20 years.``Still, there is a lot of anger toward management'' that couldprompt some workers to reject the new offer, he said.     To pass, the contract needs support from 50 percent of thevoters, plus one. The voting takes place today from 8 a.m. to 6p.m. local time and the results will be announced when all theballots have been counted, the union said. The voting in thePuget Sound area is taking place at the union hall, fairgroundand community college were workers have been picking up weeklystrike-pay checks in person on Saturdays since Sept. 27.                         Record Profits     The machinists, who build planes and parts and maintain thefactories, walked out Sept. 6 after an 80 percent ``no'' voteagainst Chicago-based Boeing's first offer. The union maintainsthat Boeing's record profits since the last contract andunprecedented orders have made it an ``island of success'' in theslumping economy and that its members deserve a greater share ofthe work and the earnings.     Boeing had a record order backlog for 3,725 planes worth$276 billion at the end of September, boosted by airlines eagerto save on fuel by using newer models.      The company has said it needs to make sure any contractimprovements still would be affordable if there's a slowdown andthat it needs to continue its outsourcing policy to remaincompetitive as new aviation companies are founded and its onlylarger rival, Toulouse, France-based Airbus SAS, builds plants inChina.--Editors: Kevin Miller, Sylvia WierTo contact the reporter on this story:Susanna Ray in Seattle at +1-206-521-2744 orsray7@bloomberg.net.To contact the editor responsible for this story:Kevin Miller in Chicago at +1-312-443-5929 orkmiller@bloomberg.net,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,K9MND80D9L35,PLAIN,By Amy Thomson     Nov. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Verizon Communications Inc., down from a low of $95 previously,spokesman Bill Kula said. Verizon is also introducing pared-downbundles of voice and Internet or TV at lower prices.     The cuts may make Verizon more attractive than cablecompetitors, such as Time Warner Cable Inc., which offers itstriple-play packages for as low as $89.85 a month for the firstyear of a three-year contract. Customers have been leaving phonecompanies to take advantage of discounts from cable providers.     ``More than anything, it just reflects the intensecompetitive nature of the industry right now and the need to getmore aggressive on price to win share,'' Robert W. Baird analystWill Power said in an interview. ``Price still matters intelecom.'' Power rates Verizon shares ``neutral.''     The new prices, which affect packages with copper phonelines, high-speed Internet and DirecTV Group Inc.'s digital TVservice, will be maintained for the first year of a customer'sservice, Verizon's Kula said. It's unclear if prices will riseif a subscriber renews the contract, he said.     Verizon shares fell 83 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $29.67 inNew York Stock Exchange composite trading on Oct. 31. The stockhas declined 32 percent this year.                        Premium Channels     FiOS, the company's fiber-optic Internet and TV service, isoffering 90 days of free HBO, Cinemax and other premium channelsto encourage cash-strapped customers to pay for extraentertainment at home, spokeswoman Bobbi Henson said.     ``With the current economy, people are staying home more,''Henson said. ``Home entertainment is the way people are going toget entertainment.''     Verizon lost 1.19 million home-phone customers in the thirdquarter. AT&T Inc., the largest U.S. phone company bysubscribers, lost 990,000.
