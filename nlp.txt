Sentiment Analysis : 
created wor2vec 
gamma distributed weighing of stock prices
cnn_model
optimization : hdf5 format, parallel computing, generator functions

NLP-Sentiment Model :
Created a word2vec model to train the pre-trained word vectors on the financial news data to better caputre the semantic relationships between financial words.
Explored probabilistic distributions to calibrate the impact of real time financial news on stock prices.
Implemented Deep ConvNets to generate sentiment signals based on intra-day financial news data spanning across multiple sectors and companies . 
Predicted the impact of real time high frequency financial news data on stock price returns with an accuracy of 78.65%
Used memory mapping, parallel computing, generators etc. to increase computational efficiency and optimizing data flow. 

Natural Language Generation : Autogenerated commentray
Took the initiative to generate financial commentary based on global market statistics using deep neural networks.
Implemented ConvNets to extract features from the daily market data and decoded them into natural language sentences using LSTMs.

NLP - Attention and Memory Networks :
Used bi-directional GRUs over distributed vector representations to copmute news and keyword embeddings.
Implemented dynamic memeory netowrk to condition its attention on relevant input representations 
Used this model to get indusrty, sector or company level sentiment signals.
