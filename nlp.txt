NLP-Sentiment Model :
1. Predicted the impact of real time high frequency financial news data on stock price returns with an accuracy of 83.65% 
2. Implemented Deep ConvNets to generate sentiment signals based on intra-day financial news data spanning across multiple sectors and companies.
3. Created a word2vec model to train the pre-trained word vectors on the financial news data to better caputre the semantic relationships between financial words.
4. Explored probabilistic distributions to calibrate the impact of real time financial news on stock prices.
5. Used memory mapping, parallel computing, generators etc. to increase computational efficiency and optimizing data flow. 

Natural Language Generation : Autogenerated commentray
1. Took the initiative to generate financial commentary based on global market statistics using deep neural networks.
2. Implemented ConvNets to extract features from the daily market data and decoded them into natural language sentences using LSTMs.

NLP - Attention and Memory Networks :
1. Used bi-directional GRUs over distributed vector representations to copmute news and keyword embeddings.
2. Implemented dynamic memeory netowrk to condition its attention on relevant input representations 
3. Used this model to get indusrty, sector or company level sentiment signals.
