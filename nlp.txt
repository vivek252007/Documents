Sentiment Analysis : 
created wor2vec 
gamma distributed weighing of stock prices
cnn_model
optimization : hdf5 format, parallel computing, generator functions

NLP-Sentiment Model :
Created a word2vec model to train the pre-trained word vectors on the financial news datat to better caputre the semantic relationships between financial words.
Used probabilistic models to calibrate the impact of real time financial news on stock prices.
Implemented Deep ConvNets to generate sentiment signals based on intra-day financial news data spanning across multiple sectors and companies . 
Predicting the impact of high frequency financial news data on the stock price returns with accuracy of 78.65%
Used memory mapping, parallel computing, generator functions etc. to increase computational efficiency and optimizing data flow. 

Natural Language Generation : Autogenerated commentray
CNN with RNN(LSTMs) 
Took the initiative to generate comments about end of day financial and economic statistic using deep neural networks
Used Convolutional Nets as encoder to generate features from the data
Used LSTMs as decoder to generate the text based on the features extracted by the convolutional layer.

NLP-
Attention and Memory Networks :
Used bi-directional GRUs along with distributed vector representations to compute news data and keywords embeddings.
Implemented attention mechanism to focus on particular news data related to specific indusrty, sector or company.
